# wcat
This is my first Javascript Project. It is called WCAT.

In this project, I have tried to code the various commands of LINUX which are listed as:
1. -rs (to remove the spaces in the files)
2. -rn (to remove new lines in the files)
3. -rsc (to remove characters or strings specified by user from the files)
4. -s (to serialize all the lines in the files)
5. -sn (to serialize only non-empty lines)
6. -rel (to remove extra lines in the files)

Additionally, I have added script called "wcat" due to which we don't have to write "node -fileName" in the terminal. We can directly call the commands by writing "wcat" only.
